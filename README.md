  Bone Idol // Netlify
</h1>

This project is a replication of [Bone Idol Originals](https://bone-idol.com) built with GatsbyJS (React) & deployed using Netlify.

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Start the development site.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd my-default-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code in your IDE of choice and start editing. See it reflected immediately in the browser!**

    The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!
    
    *Note: a second link `http://localhost:8000/___graphql` provides access to a tool you can use to experiment with querying data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).*

  1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed. Leave the management of this one to npm.
  
  2.  **`/src`**: This directory contains all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of the site.
  
  3.  **`/src`**: This is where some static resources are located, such as the code for the admin console ([netlify-cms](https://www.netlifycms.org/).
  
  4.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.
  
  5.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).
  
  6.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) that allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.
  
  7.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where metadata is specified like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins are in use, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).
  
  8.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process. This is where programmatic creation of pages from markdown files is configured, for example.
  
  9.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.
  
  10.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.
  
  11.  **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**
  
  12.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.
  
  13.  **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

## 🎓 More Info

Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

-   **The tutorials are very good e.g. [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

-   **[Documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/) is also excellent.**
