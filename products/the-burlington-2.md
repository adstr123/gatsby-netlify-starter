Our made-to-order Burlington shearling coat is hand-tailored in London to a unique breed-specific design from soft Italian sheepskin, quilted and trimmed.

The collar can be worn flat or raised, with optional bee lapel rivet. A neoprene and Velcro belly panel provides the perfect fit and the brass zip at the back allows for a harness. The front buckle strap can be worn open or closed and a leather and suede side pocket is conveniently placed for poop bags. Every coat has variants in colour and finish, being a natural product, so each is as individual as your dog.
