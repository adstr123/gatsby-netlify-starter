Our made-to-order Hyde stormproof coat is hand-tailored in London to a unique design from 100% natural cotton Ventile® fabric and a 100% organic cotton fleece lining.

Created with greyhounds, whippets and lurchers in mind who feel the cold more than most breeds but like to run without restriction. The high neck is soft jersey and has an easy-close YKK zip. The neck strap has branded snap fasteners, but can be removed altogether, and the adjustable belt with Velcro gives the option on how tight your dog would like to wear it. Sports luxe never looked so fine.
