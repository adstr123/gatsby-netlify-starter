The suede stand collar can be worn flat or raised and comes with optional bee lapel rivet. A neoprene and Velcro belly panel allows for the perfect fit, as well as practicality. The front buckle strap can be worn open or closed and the side pocket is conveniently placed for poo bags. There is a leather hook strap on the back for ease of storage.
